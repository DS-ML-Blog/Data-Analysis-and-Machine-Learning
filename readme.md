This repo contains small data analysis projects. They are based on downloading datasets (from Kaggle or similar resources) and training machine learning algorithms on them along with exploratory data analysis (EDA). The process is described on my blog webpage (ds-ml.blog). 
The following projects have been completed so far:

1. Logistic regression with Titanic dataset
2. Linear regression with weather data 
3. Classification algorithms (KNN and SVM)
4. K means clustering for grouping Starbucks cafes into clusters
5. Decision trees for loan defaults
6. Exploratory data analysis of a movies dataset
